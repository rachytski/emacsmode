emacsmode is based on eventFilters installed on a QTextEdit or a QPlainTextEdit.
It basically catches all keystrokes and modifies some internal state that
make the resulting text in the editor look like it was using emacs.

There are only a few files in here:

  emacsmodeplugin.{h,cpp}   - interaction with the rest of Creator
  emacsmodeactions.{h,cpp}  - settings
  emacsmodehandler.{h,cpp}  - the "real" event
  emacsmodeshortcut.{h,cpp} - "chained" shortcuts.

There are some more hints for developers in emacsmodehandler.cpp
